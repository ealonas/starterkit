/**
 * This file contains references to the vendor libraries we are using in this project.
 * This is used by webpack in the production build only. A separate bundle for
 * vendor code is
 * useful since it is unlikely to change as often as the application code.
 * So all libraries will
 * be referenced here so that they can be cached by the user until one of
 * the libraries change.
 * This saves the user having to redownload a huge file everytime one
 * line of code changes.
